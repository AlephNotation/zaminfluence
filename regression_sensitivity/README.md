This directory contains a Python package which is an example of
how to use custom objectives with Python automatic differentiation in
zaminfluence.  If you are interested in using a custom objective, please
feel free to reach out to the authors for guidance.  If you only need
OLS or IV regression, then this Python package is unnecessary.
